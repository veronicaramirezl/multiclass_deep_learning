# Multi class classification model that can be divided by linear metrics
We are going to use the toy dataset #BLOBs to create a DL nn that will divide multiple classes of blobs with non linear and linear functions.  
Assets: 
multi_class.ipynb = Here you can find both the import for the dataset, the training and testing loops and the model.
