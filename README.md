# multiclass_deep_learning
Multi class classification model that can be separable by linear metrics  We are gouÂ¿ing to use the toy dataset #BLOBs to create a DL nn that will classify multiple classes of blobs with non linear and linear functions.  Here you can find both the import for the dataset, the training and testing loops and the model.
